# Python
Recipe Management System (OOP-based)

Project Description:
            The Recipe Management System is a simple Python project designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
            It allows users to add, view, and search recipes, organized into Veg and Non-Veg categories.
            
Key OOP concepts:
 -Abstraction: A base abstract class Recipe defines the common structure for all recipes.
 -Inheritance: VegRecipe and NonVegRecipe classes inherit from the Recipe base class.
 -Polymorphism: Each recipe type implements its own version of the display_recipe() method.
 -Encapsulation: The RecipeManager class manages recipe data privately and provides controlled access through methods.
 -Class/Object: Objects are created from classes to represent real recipes and manage them dynamically.

This project demonstrates how OOP can make code modular, reusable, and easier to manage, especially in small-scale applications like a recipe system.
